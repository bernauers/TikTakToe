# TikTakToe Game 

Upload date: 8/6/20

This is a Milestone project from the Udemy Course: https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/ w/ Jose Portilla

The TikTacToe game works, with two humans playing. The game can be improved by allowing the player input "name" to be used instead of saying it is 'X' turn. This is something that I will work to include in the future.
